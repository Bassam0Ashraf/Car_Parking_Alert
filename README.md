# Car Parking Sensor System  

## ðŸ“– Project Overview  
Develop a car parking alert system using ATmega32 microcontroller and ultrasonic sensor to measure obstacle distance and provide visual and audio warnings to assist drivers.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives  
- Measure distance to obstacles using ultrasonic sensor and display on LCD.  
- Provide LED and buzzer alerts based on proximity thresholds.  
- Ensure safe parking with dynamic, real-time feedback.

## ðŸ’¡ Features  
- **Ultrasonic Distance Measurement:** Calculates distance and updates in real-time.  
- **LCD Display:** Shows distance in centimeters, displays "Stop" if object is â‰¤5 cm.  
- **LED Indicators:** Red, Green, and Blue LEDs light up based on proximity.  
- **Buzzer Alert:** Activates when distance â‰¤5 cm.  
- **Dynamic Feedback:** LED and buzzer behavior based on distance ranges.

## ðŸ“š Hardware Components  
- **Microcontroller:** ATmega32  
- **Ultrasonic Sensor:** HC-SR04  
- **Display:** 16x2 LCD (4-bit mode)  
- **LEDs:** Red, Green, Blue  
- **Buzzer:** Audible alert for close obstacles

## ðŸš€ Operation Highlights  
- **Ultrasonic Measurement:** Sends and receives waves to detect distance.  
- **Distance Calculation:** ATmega32 calculates and updates LCD with real-time distance.  
- **Alert Levels:**
  - â‰¤5 cm: All LEDs flash, buzzer sounds, LCD shows "Stop".  
  - 6â€“10 cm: All LEDs ON, no buzzer.  
  - 11â€“15 cm: Red & Green ON, Blue OFF.  
  - 16â€“20 cm: Red ON, others OFF.  
  - >20 cm: All LEDs OFF, buzzer OFF.  
- **Continuous Updates:** System provides real-time feedback for safe parking.
